#### Winner Takes it All

In reality, people tend to be great at many things or nothing at all.
There are multiple possible explanations for this.
Let's go back to the high school example. Person B might have straight As in every subject probably because
the counfounding factor to performance in each subject overlaps. Think of educational background of their parents or just pure intelligence.

However, it feels almost obvious that a student performing well in History will perform well in Geography as well. Or at least, it doesn't surprise us.

*Comment* it might just be because we select for these people, i.e. there are also people who are just good at one thing.

It becomes much less obvious when thinking about great founders.
